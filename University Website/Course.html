        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>B-Pharmacy</h3>
            <p> A Bachelor of Pharmacy (abbreviated B Pharm or PharmB or BS Pharm) is a graduate academic degree in the field of pharmacy. In many countries, this degree is a prerequisite for registration to practice as a pharmacist. Since both PharmB and PharmD are prerequisites to license in most western countries they're considered equivalent. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Diploma and lateral entries</h3>
            <p> The main difference between both is that B.Tech Lateral Entry requires students to have completed a diploma in engineering or a BSc with mathematics to enroll directly in the second year of a B Tech course. On the other hand, the regular B.Tech program requires students to complete 10+2 or an equivalent exam for enrollment. </p>
